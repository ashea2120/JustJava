# CE-450 Lab 3 (2019 Spring)
---
This repository is for Lab 3 submission.
 
## 1.1 Android Studio and Just Java
 
This repo is for the following Practice Set:
- Lesson 3: Making an app interactive Part 1
 
## Issues and Lessons
 
A short description about the issues that you faced and the lessons that you learned.
 
- Utilized skills from previous labs to easily plan how to build a layout before actually diving in and starting
  * i.e. Decide between LinearLayout vs. RelativeLayout and the pros and cons for both
- Enhanced skills with connecting XML code with the onClick handlers in the Java code
- Brushed up on important Java programming practices and ran through exercises by hand:
  * ie. Order of Operations (addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication) in Java 
  * Went over the "right" ways to use a variable that is shared between multiple resources (in this case, the addition and subtraction button modified the same TextView element)
- Went over how to debug a crash with the Dalvik Debug Monitor Server (DDMS)
